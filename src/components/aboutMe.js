                    Hello! I'm <b>Mihai Daniel</b>, and I'm the one who brings fresh ideas and an inexhaustible passion for creating something new to the world of programming!
                    <br /><br />
                     My journey started with <b>Python development</b>, but I soon realized that the IT world is so diverse and exciting that I wanted to try something else. Switching to the <b>Fullstack development</b> path opened up a whole new level of possibilities for me. And now I'm doing <b>Frontend development</b>, but this is just the beginning. I donâ€™t stop there and continue to explore the world of <b>Backend development</b>, striving for maximum coverage of knowledge and skills.

                        My goal as a programmer is not just to follow a path, but to <b>create new paths.</b> I strive for innovation in web development, looking for new approaches, fresh ideas and <b>non-standard solutions.</b> I am interested not only in what already exists, but also in what has not yet been realized.
                       <br /><br />
                       If you are looking for someone who is not afraid to challenge standards and lead the way, then you have found me. I am ready <b>to take on any challenges</b> and bring the most daring ideas to life. <b>Let's create the future of web development together!</b>
